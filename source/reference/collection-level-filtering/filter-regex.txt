Syntax
======

To match databases and collections for ``mongosync`` to use :ref:`c2c-filtered-sync`,
you can use regular expressions:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
      "databaseRegex": {
         "pattern": "<string>",
         "options": "<string>"
      },
      "collectionRegex": {
         "pattern": "<string>",
         "options": "<string>"
      }
   }

Regular expressions in filter documents use the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``collectionRegex``
     - document
     - Specifies which collections you want the filter
       to match.

   * - ``collectionRegex.options``
     - string
     - Regular expression options to use in the match.
       
   * - ``collectionRegex.pattern``
     - string
     - Regular expression pattern to match.


   * - ``databaseRegex``
     - document
     - Specifies which databases you want the filter 
       to match.

   * - ``databaseRegex.options``
     - string
     - Regular expression options to use in the match.

   * - ``databaseRegex.pattern``
     - string
     - Regular expression pattern to match.

These options are available to use with both the ``includeNamespaces``
and ``excludeNamespaces`` parameters.

Use Cases
=========

Regular expressions allow you match multiple databases or collections with a
single pattern.  If you want to match multiple similarly named 
databases or collections, a regular expression may be easier to match than
creating a series of filters for individual databases or groups of collections.

Details
=======

Regular Expression Options
--------------------------

``databaseRegex`` and ``collectionRegex`` each supports an ``options`` field,
which you can use to configure regular expression options.
Internally, ``mongosync`` passes the filter and options to the
:query:`$regex` operator. Options available to that operator can be used
with Filtred Sync.

For example, this filter would match collections in the ``sales`` database
that begin start with the ``accounts_`` string:

.. code-block:: json

   "includeNamespaces": [
      {
         "database": "sales",
         "collectionRegex": {
            "pattern": "^accounts_.+?",
            "options": "ms"
         }
      }
   ]
