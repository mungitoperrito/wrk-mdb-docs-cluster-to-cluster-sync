1.6.0 Release
-------------

**September 18, 2023**

Exclusion Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.6.0, the :ref:`c2c-api-start` API endpoint now supports the
use of exclusion filters through the ``excludeNamespaces`` parameter.

For more information, see :ref:`c2c-filtered-sync`.

Regular Expression Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both inclusion and exclusion filters in :ref:`c2c-filtered-sync` now 
support matching databases and collections using Regular Expressions 
with the ``databaseRegex`` and ``collectionRegex`` fields.

For more information, see :ref:`c2c-filter-regex`.

7.0 Support
~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.6.0, ``mongosync`` supports sync with MongoDB 7.0.

Other Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

New Features:

- Sped up the commit process by parallelizing metadata cleanup. 

- Reduced memory allocation during change event application by approximately 
  30% for pre-6.0 releases of MongoDB Server versions.

- Changed telemetry to also send error messages to Segment when ``mongosync``
  exits with a fatal error.

- Added support for ``mongosync`` to sync between source and destination 
  clusters that have the same major and minor versions, but different 
  patch versions.

- Upgraded build to use Go 1.20.

- ``mongosync`` now periodically logs when server operations take a longer 
  than expected time.

Issues Fixed:

- Fixed a bug introduced in 1.5, where ``mongosync`` could fail to apply change
  events for a document if they occur shortly after the document is copied during
  the Collection Copy phase.

- Fixed a bug where ``mongosync`` could crash due to the source cluster containing
  legacy indexes with unknown index options.

- Fixed a bug where ``mongosync`` could crash with an error during change event 
  application, if the application fails to read 500 documents within 5 minutes
  or reaches the end of the oplog when reading from change streams on the source
  cluster.

- Fixed a bug where ``mongosync`` could crash when indexes apply constraints 
  to collection documents.

  This crash occured when such an index was added or dropped at nearly the same
  time as an index that violated these constrains was deleted or inserted.  It 
  would manifest with an error like:

  .. code-block:: text
     :copyable: false

     Ambiguous field name found in array (do not use numeric field names in embedded elements in an array)

  or a similar error. This fix makes this crash less likely, but it does not
  elimiate the possibility that it will occur.



- Fixed a bug where ``mongosync`` can fail to copy certain documents if 
  the insertion of documents causes duplicate key errors at the same time 
  as a write concern error. This bug has been present in mongosync since its first release and may have arisen if the destination cluster logs reported a write concern error alongside a duplicate key error.

Minimum Supported Version
-------------------------

In 1.6, the minimum supported versions of MongoDB are 6.0.8 and 7.0.0.
