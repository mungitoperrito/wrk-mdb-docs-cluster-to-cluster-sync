This page provides answers to some frequently asked questions we have
encountered. If you have additional questions please contact MongoDB
Support.

Does ``mongosync`` have to use the same operating system as MongoDB Enterprise Server? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When ``mongosync`` runs on its own hardware, it does not have to use
the same operation system (OS) as the source or destination clusters.

Should I increase the size of the oplog in the source cluster?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you anticipate synchronizing a large data set, or if you plan to
pause synchronization for an extended period of time, please increase
the size of the replica set :term:`oplog` in the source cluster.

The ``oplog`` in the source cluster must be large enough to track
events that happen during the time it takes to complete the initial
sync to the destination cluster.
 
To learn more about how to increase the size of the ``oplog``, see:
:ref:`tutorial-change-oplog-size`. 

Which connection string options does ``mongosync`` allow?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(e.g. connection string URI contains custom read preference, tags, etc)?

``mongosync`` requires :ref:`readConcern: "majority" <read-concern>`
and :ref:`writeConcern: "majority" <write-concern>`. ``mongosync`` 
overwrites any other ``readConcern`` or ``writeConcern`` and uses
``"majority"`` instead.

``monogosync`` accepts all other :ref:`connection string options
<mongodb-uri>`.


Which security and authentication options are supported?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` uses a standard MongoDB :ref:`connection string
<mongodb-uri>` to connect to the source and destination clusters. 

:ref:`LDAP <security-auth-ldap>` and :ref:`X509
<authentication-mechanism-x509>` are supported. For available
authentication options, see :ref:`authentication`.


Can I configure ``mongosync`` for high availability?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` is stateless. The metadata for restarting is stored on
the destination cluster.

A ``mongosync`` operation can be resumed if ``mongosync`` is
unavailable during synchronization. When ``mongosync`` becomes
available, restart the ``mongosync`` process with the same parameters.
``mongosync`` resumes from where it left off.

There is no automatic failover built into ``mongosync``, however you
can write a script or use your operating system's process managers,
``systemd`` for example, to restart the ``mongosync`` process. 


Can the source or destination be a replica set with arbiters? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. The source replica-set must have more than 2 non-arbiter node.
Please refer to read preference options to specify in the source clusterâ€™s
connection string a data-bearing (non-arbiter) node to sync from.
